The provided C++ code implements a binary search tree (BST) data structure. It includes functions to insert and delete nodes, as well as to perform an in-order traversal. The 'node' struct represents a node in the BST, and the 'New_node' function creates a new node with a given key. The 'insertNode' function inserts a node with a specified key into the BST. The 'deleteNode' function removes a node with a given key. The 'traverseInOrder' function performs an in-order traversal to display the elements in ascending order. The main function reads input operations for insertion and deletion, and the program processes these operations accordingly.
